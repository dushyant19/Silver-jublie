          <p style="font-size: 17px; color: #7B7B7B;">IIT Guwahati has just completed 25 years of its successful journey.During this period it has demonstrated its capability of doing world-class research
            by entering into the list of top 100 young(less than 50 years) universities of the world.Now it is the high time that we should orient and utilize our research capability and infrastructure to address country's needs. While IIT Guwahati is 
            providing technical expertise to various agencies in their endavour, we need to do lot more for bringing a visible change in the society through need based proactive innovative research. In India and in many other developing countries, people 
            still believe that technological intervention from the developed world can only provide a solution to our problem. Generating confidence on IITs technical capability among the masses is the responsibility of IIT, I believe.
            While extending technical expertise in different developing countries, we have observed that they are looking towards us (India) for a solution to their problem. In India, our people look towards the developed world for a solution to our problem. 
           Thus it is the so-called level of development of a country that influences the mind-set to look towards those who appear to be at a higher level. Unlike other IIT's , IIT Guwahati came into existence as per an agreement made in the Assam Accord. 
           This has happened because of scarifies made by many. Being located in the North-eastern part of India, which is relatively less developed as compared to many other parts of the country, IIT Guwahati has a moral responsibility and aalso has the scope to 
           demonstrate that innovative technological intervention can bring a change to the society. With a strong determination we can set an example for others towards a developed India. IIT Guwahati came witha commitment to fulfil the dream of the people-
           a dream of developed Northeast India through technological intervention. People love seeing IIT Guwahati at a high rank; happiness will be increasing by many folds if they see IIT Guwahati in a developed India. While rank of an Institute can make the image 
           of a country marginally higher, the rank of a country as a whole can take the image of its all institutes to a much higher level.</p>

           <p style="font-size: 17px; color: #7B7B7B;">>We strongly believe, IIT Guwahati is not ust an Institute, but is a journey on the path of light, a mission for a brighter future. It's a place of in-depth thought of unfurl our vision beyond horizon. With purity of mind, through our innovative research 
             and discovery, we will conquer all obstacles that may come on our way. Technology ground is now illuminated and through it we see a glorious India. We welcome all great minds to join the journey so that knowledge flows seamlessly like the river Brahmaputra(Luit) 
             flowing by our side. Let's join hands in making a glorious India.

                Greetings from the desk of the Director on the occasion
of Silver Jubilee year of IIT Guwahati and Happy New
Year 2020. Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Guwahati
was established in the year 1994 and has completed
25 years of glorious existence. Within this short span,
IIT Guwahati has been the only academic institution
from India that occupied a place among the top 100
world universities - under 50 years of age - published
by London based Times Higher Education (THE) in the
year 2014 and continues to do this even today in various
International Rankings. Along with older IITs and Delhi
University, lIT Guwahati has also been ranked below 500
in the QS World ranking released recently. lIT Guwahati
ranks 7th among the leading science and research
institutions in India in terms of research citation and 20th
in the world in Chemistry as evaluated by the Nature, the
most reputed scientifIc research magazine and one of the
highest faculty to publication ration of ~4.5. IIT Guwahati
has been ranked 7th (Engineering) and 9th (Overall) in
the national institutional ranking framework conducted
by MHRD in the year 2018. IIT Guwahati has also been
ranked 3rd in the "Swachhata Ranking" conducted by the
Gol and is the only centrally funded technical institute to
be among the top 5 consistently for the past three years
ever since these rankings were launched. IIT Guwahati
has one of the most beautiful educational campuses in
the country that provides an ideal setting for learning
and research and we believe that "Learning in tandem
with the tides of the mighty Brahmaputra at the vibrant
campus of IIT Guwahati" is an experience we as a
community have been blessed with. It is strongly believed
that IIT Guwahati has been able to fulfIll the aspirations
of people of the North East region to a large extent,
since its inception was through Assam Accord signed in
1985. The institute is fully residential for the students,
enriched with world-class facilities and is empowered
with a young and dynamic faculty and staff. The vision of
IITG is to become a preferred destination of seeking best
science, engineering and technology education and to
be recognized internationally for excellence in research,
pursuit for developmental activities and deep concern
for students' care. An important feature of academic
excellence is the continuous replenishment of ideas
and creation of new areas of research and innovation,
attracting organizations seeking collaboration in
education, research and development as well as product
development. In a fast changing world, keeping pace
with the ever-increasing number of areas of research and
application poses a major challenge to this Institute. IIT
Guwahati is trying to augment the research initiatives
in all the areas of Sciences and Technology in general
and in Nano-science and technology, Bioengineering and
Data sciences in particular. Initiation of research in some
of the cutting edge areas of Biological sciences namely
Genomics, Developmental Biology, Health Care and
Bioinformatics, Flexible Electronics, Advanced Functional
Materials, Sustainable Polymers, Water Resources and
Management is a testament to the aspiration of IIT
Guwahati to excel in research. The Scope of Environmental
Science and Data science is inherently interdisciplinary
and expanding rapidly. Recognizing the challenges for
environmentally sustainable development, IIT Guwahati
emphasizes an interdisciplinary research paradigm in
Energy and Environment to solve problems that have
important societal impact. It is indeed a challenging
task to match the ever-increasing need for funds and
providing infrastructure for these emerging and futuristic
research areas, and lIT Guwahati has resolutely taken this
challenge in its stride.
              <br><br>
                Furthur IIT Guwahati has set goals to be recognized as one of the world's top 150 Institutes/Universities within next five years. This will include attracting external grants and research funding at the level of internationally well ranked institutes, to furnish state-of-the art facilities for all programs, attract international faculty and students to spend time at IIT Guwahti, enhance the perception globally, 
                fostering academic excellence and freedom while maintaining rigorous academic standards and to become a preffered destination for transformative educational experience.
              <br><br>
                The strategic commitment rovides the road map of the long journey. The strategies include the Mission,vision ,Goal annd values that would be instruemental in placing IIT Guwahati among top academic institutions of the world. These strategies will create new opportunities for the faculty and students for enhancement of knowledge, 
                performing cutting edge research and development of proffessional skills. The ultimate aim is to provide the students withan educational training that emphasizes innovation, social awarenessand proffessional ethicswhile promoting the spirit ofcreativity amongst our researchers.
              <br><br>
                An important feature of academic excellence is the
                continuous replenishment of ideas and creation of
                new areas of research, innovation and incubation.
While the world has experienced the miracles brought
about by the Indian engineers and technologists in
Information Technology, IIT Guwahati is trying to leap
forward by embracing the rising demands of newer
and interdisciplinary areas of research and technology
development by incorporating industry participating in
offering courses in futuristic areas of artifIcial intelligence,
robotics and machine learning while focusing on other
areas, involving Design and Manufacturing, Power
Generation and Distribution, Construction Technology,
Water resources and management that are essential and
in forefront of development in the coming decade.
              <br><br>
                It is indeed a challenging task to match the ever-increasing
need for funds and providing infrastructure for these
emerging areas, and IIT Guwahati has resolutely taken
this challenge in its stride. Since major technological
developments in the future would require expertise from
various disciplines, IIT Guwahati has been promoting the
concept of virtual research departments. One such group
is working on the development of Electrical Vehicles. The
endeavors for a High performance-computing center,
a research center for Computer Security are the other
goals in this direction. IIT Guwahati also plans to retain
its excellence and reputation in the area of Sustainable
Polymers. The Center of Excellence in Sustainable
Polymers integrates sustainability issues that focus on
the science and technology of polymeric materials into
research, education, and products. High performance
computing and Computer Security are also areas under
focus. Such initiatives will take IIT Guwahati to greater
heights similar to that enjoyed by the top Universities
in the world. The new initiatives in the Biological
Sciences, Experimental Physics, Environmental Studies,
Computational Mechanics, Quantum Computing, NanoTechnology,
Theranostics augur well for this spirit
of excellence in this Institute. In the years to come,
IT Guwahati, we hope, would become the ultimate
destination of scholars and scientists from the world over.
In addition, the institute is also enhancing its curriculum
in view of the enhanced demands from industry and
academia that would ensure that the students are
prepared for the broadened world of engineering and
technological trends. Personnel exchange between
industry / government and academia through visiting
professorships and sabbaticals or summer leaves in
industry and government are also being pursued. The
industry has also embarked on undertaking research
based on social and societal problems while expanding
research directed towards solving regional challenges. In a
renewed drive towards community impact, developmental
activities are essential. Some of these encompass intrainstitutional
collaborations to bring together the best
of resources in the national interest and moving from
tower of excellence to network of excellence. As a unique
initiative, IIT Guwahati will also host students from
Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh region to spend few
weeks during the summer break beginning 2020.
The challenge for the Institute is to create the optimum
research eco system and enhance the ambiance where each
individual would be encouraged for performing cutting
edge research and development. In particular, to promote
quality research, the Institute is planning to identify and
reward excellence in research where active participation
of majority of the faculty members to attract research
funding would improve research accomplishments.
The patents and publications, technology transfers,
encouraging entrepreneurship would be valued most
while taking a stock of the human inventory. While IIT
Guwahati embarks on the next phase of its journey, the
society has greater expectations from this institute of
higher learning. Aligning with its vision and mission,
IIT Guwahati would always remain committed to student
growth, social upliftment and generate knowledge and
